# Capstone-Project

Presented the end effector with one actuator that meets the design objectives in terms of:
1. simple mechanical structure of the end effector due to usage of a four-bar linkage system;
2. a low cost due to usage of a single actuator, 3D printing prototyping technology, and off-the-shelf components
